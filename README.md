# Video-Game-SQL-Project

SCENARIO: For this SQL project, I decided to work with a video game dataset from Kaggle which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales) 
because video games are one of my favorite hobbies and I wanted to learn more about video game sales to see which platform, year, genre, publisher, and region makes the 
most sales throughout the lifetime of video games. So if I was a stakeholder, some questions that could be asked include: What platform has the most games? What platform 
has the most video game sales? What genre generates the most sales? Which publisher generates the most sales? Which region spends the most? What are the top 10 selling games?
What genre is popular in different regions? Etc. These were some of the questions that I explored in order to analyze the data that was avaliable.

The dataset included 11 columns: Rank, Name, Platform, Year, Genre, Publisher, NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales, and Global_Sales.

My visualizations for this project can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brenden.lai/viz/Videogameindustryfrom1980-2016/Story1) which explored various questions that stakeholders may have about a video game dataset.
